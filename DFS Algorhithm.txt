Initialise MinFullPath to integer.Maxint

Add the initial State(Empty, VisitedList(root),CandidateList(roots' children),currentCost) to the Priority Queue

While the priorityQueue is not empty:
    Generate the possibilities involving one node from the candidate list
    If we have traversed all nodes and cost is less than the minFullPathCost:
        Add the possibilities onto the priority queue
    Else:
        Add the possibilities onto the priority queue
    Pop off the priority queue

    if current is full state and cheaper than minFullPath:
        replace minFullPath

        For all states in priority queue:
            If cost is less than the minFullPathCost:
                Remove it from the priority queue
done

Select the State with cheapest DFS cost
