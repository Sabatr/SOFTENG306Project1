Before calling dfs, find the level of each vertex, which will be the greatest level of the previous vertecies + 1
Run dfs on the verticies with the highest level(Place in Priority q and use a comparator to have hte highest come first)
Run the gfg DFS. And cache results in hashmap
Ensure the hashmap is checked for a given vertex before moving on.
