Keep Track of past states which are the same
    E.g <Process, Task> = <<1,a>,<2,b>,<3,c>> is the same as <<1,a><2,c><2,b>>
    Sort by first element then concat to string.
    1a 2b 3c => a,b,c
    1,a,2,c,3,b => a,b,c
    Get alias function? -> two things of the same node type. cost, switch time and

A* heuristic
	Currently checks for the lowest cost to the end
	Lower bound
	The bottom level - time take on the longest processor
	Always an underestimate
	Enqueue initial<level,heuristic values/estimated cost values
	For state 5,earliest start time is 4(2+2),   4+4 = 8
	For state 6, earliest start time is 2(2) Bottom level is 5(2+3)

	1:14 The order 2 should be 6 and 5 and 3 and 4 and 7
	Now the fix/six will be level 2 and 7. and 5 will be level 2 and it will be 8 and 3 will be 
	1:15 wtf is he saying and a ntoher will be 3 and another should be 5
	now its 1,7 2,8 and its 4, its 5 adn this is level 2

	For state 16, earliest execution time for b is 5, and the bottom level will be 4 and for the state 17, the earliest start time is 4 for 4 and the bottom level is 4 so its 8

	SO the priority queue will be 7 

	We considered 8 here, with heauristics 8 but lower level
	17, 4,5,5,7,16,level 3 its 9

	state 3 morphs into 8,9,10,11
	3 will be removed then it becomes 17,16 and then 2,3,4,6

	state 8 level 2 execution of b earliest start time is 4 cause diff processor with respect to a . Bottom level of b will be 4

	State 9 earliest start time is 2. Bottom level of b is 4 so it will be 6

	State 10 easrliest start time is 3, bottom level of c is 5 so it will be 8

	state 11 : earliset start time is 2 plus 5 is 7

	state 16 will still be the head.

	3 8 head is actually state 9 then 17,3,8,11,2,7,and 
	11, 2, 7 ,8 ,17, 
	all of them are now 8
	with level 2
	and then the 16 here

	State 22 earliest execution time is 3. 3 plus execution of c is 6. Bottom level of c is 5 . 
	State 23 earliest execution time is 4. bottom level of c is 5. THere will be nine/line

	State 26: Bottom level of b will be 4, earliest execution time is  8

	State 27: earliest execution time will be 5  + 4 = 9( Bottom level??)

	17/22/27

	Minimise the load and idle time for all processors - design own heuristics for 

	Parallellist it
.
	Bottom level: longest path to exist task starting with node ( ignore weights)
